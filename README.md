# Citizenlab Front-End Developer Assignment

## Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to develop a small single page React application, displaying participation projects for the imaginary city called Labbersville. A participation project is a project launched by the city officials to crowdsource ideas around a certain topic. In this repository you can find all the files and assets: Texts, graphics and mock API responses with all the available data.

## Assignment
The assignment is to make an attractive listing page of participation projects for the imaginary city Labbersville, intended for its citizens. It acts as a landing page for the site. Your goal is to build that page and make sure it is intuitive and attractive for citizens.

### Logo and welcome text
The logo and welcome text of the city should be visible.

### Listing the projects
The homepage should list all the projects. Every project should at least show a title, the number of ideas it contains and the number of engaged users. Feel free to be creative and display more, the API responses contain extra metadata.

### Project selection
Citizens should be able to subscribe to receive email updates on projects that interest them. Add a `Subscribe to projects` button. When the user clicks it, the projects in the listing become selectable. A button is shown with the label `Confirm subscription to x projects`, where x is the amount of projects the user has selected. When the user confirms by clicking the button, the projects listing goes back to normal.

### Bonus: Most popular tags
Users should be able to see the most popular tags used on the platform. The tags act as filters on the content, but you don't have to implement any actual filtering. Make sure it's intuitive and clear to the users, and feel free to be creative.

## Things you shouldn't do
Your time is very limited, so here are some things you explicitly **don't** have to waste time on.
- Create a back-end API, just fake it using the provided data
- Extra efforts to make your page responsive, we'll check it with a desktop browser
- Any form of authentication

## Checklist

Issues and blockers can't always be predicted and writing software under time pressure is hard. It's okay if you don't get everything done. Include the following section in your own README file and cross (`[x]`) the items you were able to complete.

- [ ] Logo and welcome text
- [ ] Listing the projects
- [ ] Project selection
- [ ] Bonus: Most popular tags
- [ ] Bonus: ... (surprise us!))

## Rules

* You have **3 hours** to get as far as you can.
* You can use **any mix of languages, libraries or frameworks** you want. Pick whatever you're comfortable with, it won't affect your evaluation. Just make sure to include instructions in the README on how we should run your solution.
* If you base some of your work on **specific code snippets**, StackOverflow answers, gists or tutorials, add a link to them in your code comments. We don't consider this a weakness.
* You've **written** all code that doesn't include such a comment **yourself**.
* We'll only take commits within the 3 hour limit into account.

## Getting started

1. Click [here](https://github.com/CitizenLabDotCo/cl-assignment-frontend/generate) or click the green `Use this template` button on top to make a private copy of this repository. On the next screen, make sure to pick your user account and *not* CitizenLabDotCo as the owner, or you'll get an error.

2. Git clone your own repository on your machine.

3. Put all your code in there

4. Make sure to update the README with instructions on how to run your solution and the filled out above checklist

5. Share your repository with github user `kogre`

## Evaluation

The evaluation is based on 2 axis:

### Engineering
Are you respecting all aspects of a good engineered project, including abstractions, modularity, maintainability, testability. Is it easy to understand? Are you making good use of the capabilities of the libraries/frameworks you chose?

### UX/UI Design
How does the result look and feel? Is it easy to use and understand? Is it attractive? Fun to use? Is it clear? What message does it convey?

### Process
If you've impressed us with your work, we'll invite you for a discussion with our engineering team. Your process will be at least as important as the result of the assignment itself.

Thank you and good luck!
